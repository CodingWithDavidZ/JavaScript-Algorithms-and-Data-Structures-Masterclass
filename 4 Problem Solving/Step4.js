//Solve or Simplify

//Example:
//Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string

function charCount(str) {
	//make object to return at end
	//loop over string, for each character...
	// if char is a number/letter AND is a key in object, add one to count
	//if char is not a key in object AND is a number/letter, add it and set count to one.
	//if char is something else (space, period, etc.) don't do anything
	//return object at end
}
