// Break it down
//	Explicitly write out the steps you need to take
//		 â—‹ Forces you to think about the code you'll write before you write it, 
//         and helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings
//         before you dive in and have to worry about details as well.

//Example:
//Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string


function charCount(str){
    //do something
    // return an object with keys that are lowercase alphanumeric characters in the string; values should be the count for those characters
}
